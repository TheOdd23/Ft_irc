# ft_irc

The goal was to create an IRC (Internet, Relay, Chat), by setting up a minimalistic server and implementing the basic IRC commands, such as PRIVMSG, NICK, NOTICE, JOIN, etc.

Our IRC was made to work with an external client, so we had to make sure our server was sending the right responses to the right sockets to make sure the client reacts as expected.
